Your `.gitignore` looks good overall. It covers standard Python project files and dependencies well. A few observations:

**Good:**
- Covers Python bytecode, virtual environments, and build artifacts
- Includes Streamlit secrets
- Includes common IDE files and lock files

**Considerations:**
- Ignoring `main.py` might be too broad if it's a core project file you want to version control
- The commented-out `.idea/` is fine if you prefer to include IDE settings, but uncomment it if you want to exclude PyCharm files entirely

If `main.py` is your entry point, consider removing that line and committing it instead.
